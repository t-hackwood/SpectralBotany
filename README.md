# Spectral Botany - Casuarina cristata example

The [SpectralBotany notebook](https://github.com/t-hackwood/SpectralBotany/blob/main/notebooks/SpectralBotany.ipynb) demonstrates how segments and
spectral diversity variables derived from multispectral remote sensing imagery, Sentinel 2 in this case, can be used to predict the distribution of plant species.

An example of spectral coefficient of variation (COV) is displayed below as an RGB as an example of how different vegetation types and systems (e.g., cropping vs forest)
will have different spectral diversity profiles.

Pictured below is the predicted probability for the Semi-evergreen Vine Thicket (SVT) Broad Vegetation Group (BVG) in the Southern Brigalow Belt bioregion in Queensland, Australia.
SVT is an example of a vegetation community with high species richness and distribution modelling may benefit from spectral diversity predictor variables.
